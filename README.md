# 3dsounds-fivem

Just a way to play 3d sounds with spacial sound in fivem, as i didn't see any resource doing it i figured i'd do it myself.
Did this for my test server, code might have trash here and there and missing a few functionalities, but it works for playing quick 3d sounds ( door opening, etc )
